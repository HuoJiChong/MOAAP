# MOAAP

Updated source codes for book [Mastering OpenCV Android Application Programming](https://www.amazon.cn/Mastering-OpenCV-Android-Application-Programming-Kapur-Salil/dp/B012GGB7O8) and it's Chinese edition [《深入OpenCV Android应用开发》](http://item.jd.com/11958048.html).

The book is written by Salil Kapur and Nisarg Thakkar, and translated into Chinese by [John Hany](https://github.com/johnhany). The english edition was first published by Packt Publishin in July, 2015, and the Chinese edition in June, 2016. Many pieces of codes in the book have been deprecated over the time. This repository aims to provide  source codes for the latest developing and building tools (Android Studio, Android SDK, NDK and OpenCV) and to achieve the exact functionalities of original codes in the book.

## Requirements

* JDK 8u171
* Android Studio 3.1.2
* Android 8.0 (API 26)
* Gradle 4.4
* Android Plugin 3.1.2
* Android NDK r17
* OpenCV Android SDK 3.2.0 (including opencv_contrib 3.2.0)

All tests are passed on Windows 10 and Ubuntu 16.04.

For Chp3 and Chp6, configuring native build with CMake in Android Studio is required.

For Chp3, compiling OpenCV Android SDK with opencv_contrib modules on Ubuntu is required.

For Chp7, [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) dataset is required. A pre-trained SVM classifier is available [here](http://pan.baidu.com/s/1nuS3M9F). Please copy `train-images.idx3-ubyte`, `train-labels.idx1-ubyte` and `SVM_MNIST.xml` files to root directory of sd-card in your Android device. C++ codes for training and testing SVM and KNN on PC are provided [here](https://gist.github.com/johnhany/ff6835b2191e58f96699645b2d36c1a1) and [here](https://gist.github.com/johnhany/a48487dcacdb4c2108e919b421d19cfb).
